# Project Introduction: Exploring Delhi Metro Network through Station Analysis

This project aims to deeply analyze the Delhi Metro network, focusing on its stations within the bustling cityscape. By thoroughly cleaning data, using visualization tools, and conducting detailed analysis, we seek to uncover insights about station evolution, distribution, ridership, and network density.

## Overview:

The project is divided into five main parts, each concentrating on a vital aspect of metro station analysis:

## a) Data Cleaning and Visualization:

We prioritize data integrity by removing duplicates, fixing location discrepancies, and organizing the dataset for clarity. Visualizations using folium help us grasp station distribution and characteristics effectively.

## b) Average Ridership Comparison on Busiest Day:

We analyze ridership across metro lines on September 4th, 2023, understanding how each line copes with peak transit demands.

## c) Temporal Analysis:

Tracing station growth from 2002 to 2019, both per line and overall, helps us understand the metro network's evolution, identifying key milestones and phases of expansion.

## d) Ground Layout Analysis:

Visualizing station distribution on the ground offers insights into urban development. We explore how station openings correlate with ground layout characteristics, providing a nuanced understanding of metro infrastructure integration with the cityscape.

## e) Average and Total Distance Analysis:

We calculate the distance between stations per line, crucial for optimizing transit routes and improving accessibility.

# Dataset 
## The provided dataset contains information about several metro stations, including their:

- **Station ID**
- **Station Name**
- **Distance from Start (km)**
- **Line**
- **Opening Date**
- **Station Layout**
- **Geographical Coordinates (Latitude and Longitude)**

These stations are part of a diverse metro network, facilitating transportation across different areas.

The dataset showcases the evolution and expansion of the metro system over time, with stations ranging from those opened in the early 2000s to more recent additions in the late 2010s. Each station serves as a crucial node within its respective metro line, contributing to the overall connectivity and accessibility of the urban landscape.

This dataset provides valuable insights for various analyses, such as understanding the distribution of metro infrastructure, identifying transportation patterns, and assessing the impact of metro development on urban mobility and accessibility. It serves as a foundation for further research and planning aimed at enhancing public transportation systems and fostering sustainable urban development.
